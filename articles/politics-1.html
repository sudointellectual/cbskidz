<p> PHILADELPHIA -- When Hillary Clinton takes the stage Thursday night in Philadelphia to formally accept the Democratic nomination, 93-year-old Ruby Gilliam will be in the audience listening.</p>
<p> But as excited as Gilliam is to be in the room for Clinton's historic moment, for her, watching political history is nothing new: this year marks her eighth consecutive Democratic convention. Gilliam, a longtime fixture in Ohio Democratic politics, is officially the oldest delegate at the convention this July.</p>
<p> "I'm looking forward to Hillary, not just because she's a woman but because she's qualified," she said. "She has the qualifications to be the president of the United States."</p>
