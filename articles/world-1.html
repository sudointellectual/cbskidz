<h3>Historic Nomination</h3>
<p>Hillary Clinton's historic nomination for president by the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In a paper published Tuesday in the journal Marine Mammal Science, Morin and fellow authors describe analyzing 178 <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Some tooltip text!">beaked whale</a> specimens from around the Pacific Rim. They found five that matched with the Japanese whales.</p><p>The oldest was a skull in the Smithsonian Institution recovered from the Aleutians in 1948 and formerly thought to be a Baird's beaked whale. Another specimen discovered in Alaska was in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History.</p><p>The Southwest Fisheries Science Center had tissue from a whale found floating in the Bering Sea. It also had tissue from a black beaked whale stranded on Unalaska Island in the Aleutians in 2004. Local teachers and students had photographed and measured the animal, and its skeleton was put on display at Unalaska High School.</p><p>The most recent was a 24-foot, adult specimen that washed up in 2014 on <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Some tooltip text!">St. George Island</a>, in the Bering Sea. Residents notified Michelle Ridgeway, a marine ecologist with Oceanus Alaska, who documented the animal.</p><p>"We knew it was not any whale we knew from our area," Ridgway said in the announcement.</p><p>Little is known about the range of the new species, although the St. George Island whale give a clue. The whale had scars from cookie-cutter sharks, which live in tropical waters and bite flesh from larger creatures, like a cookie cutter out of dough.</p><p>Morin said scientists have more questions than answers about the new species, which is about two-thirds the size of a Baird's beaked whale.</p><p>"They're hard to see, especially if the water is anything but perfectly calm," he said, adding that acoustic research may help find them so they can be studied.</p><p>Japanese researchers are in the formal process of "describing" the species, Morin said. That will include giving the whale a Latin and common name and formally defining its measurements and how it differs from other beaked whales.</p>
