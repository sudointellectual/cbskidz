<p>The theme of the fourth and final night of the Democratic convention focused on Clinton's campaign slogan, "Stronger Together." Clinton spoke about ensuring that the country remains united--not just within the Democratic Party, but across ideological lines.</p>

"Our country's motto is E Pluribus Unum; out of many, we are one," she said. "Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention--he wants to divide us, from the rest of the world, and from each other."

With a reference to Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign slogan, she quipped that Trump has taken Republicans "a long way, from 'Morning in America' to midnight in America."
