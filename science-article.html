<h3> Mysterious purple sea orb stymies scientists </h3>

<p> "Have a look at that dark purple blob on the left, there." </br>

With those words, scientists aboard the Exploration Vessel Nautilus uncovered a marine mystery: a small purple orb tucked halfway under a rock off the coast of California.</p>

<p> Researchers are so far stumped as to what the colorful, bumpy little ball might be. Their best guess is that it might be a gastropod (a mollusk such as a snail or slug that belongs to the class Gastropoda) called a pleurobranch -- and possibly a new species. </p>

<p> "None of the known species of California pleurobranch are purple," said Susan Poulton, a spokeswoman for the E/V Nautilus expeditions. </p>

<h4> Oddball creature</h4>

<p> The odd little creature, which unfurled into two lobes once it was brought onboard the ship, is about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across. It was found on July 18, during an E/V Nautilus exploration of Arguello Canyon, west of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
